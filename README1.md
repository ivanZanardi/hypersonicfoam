# HypersonicFOAM

#### Hypersonic gas dynamics code for OpenFOAM

HypersonicFOAM is an extension of [hyStrath](https://github.com/vincentcasseau/hyStrath) written in C++ fashion for the OpenFOAM toolbox.

---
## Includes
In **hyStrath** (look at the original version of the [code](https://github.com/vincentcasseau/hyStrath) for more details):

+ *hyFoam*: a CFD solver for supersonic combusting flows;  
+ *hy2Foam*: a CFD solver for hypersonic reacting flows;  
+ *hy2MhdFoam*: the *hy2Foam* solver with additional MagnetoHydroDynamics (MHD) capabilities.  

Compared to the original version, the code has been modified by improving or implementing from scratch the following new features:

+ Kurganov scheme calculation capability for the convective term in species conservation equations [3];  
+ Electronic energy reactive source term generated during the ionization process [4];  
+ Gupta mixing rule [4];  
+ Attractive (ion–electron) or repulsive (ion–ion and electron–electron) shielded Coulomb potential by Mason *et al.* [5];  
+ Appleton-Bray model for E-T energy transfer [4];  
+ V-T relaxation time models and dissociation rates constants proposed by Shatalov *et al.* [6].  

In **hyPoliMi**:

+ *rhoCentralReactingFoam*: a CFD solver for supersonic reacting flows based on the latest version of *rhoCentralFoam*.

## Compatibility, Download and Installation

### Compatibility
+ hyStrath: [OpenFOAM-v1706](https://sourceforge.net/projects/openfoam/files/v1706)
+ hyPoliMi: [OpenFOAM-v1912](https://sourceforge.net/projects/openfoam/files/v1912)

### Download
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ivanZanardi/hypersonicfoam
```

### Installation
For **hyStrath**:
```sh
cd hyStrath/  
./install-all.sh 2 2>&1 | tee log.install
```

For **hyPoliMi**:
```sh
cd hyPoliMi/  
./install.sh 2 2>&1 | tee log.install
```

where _2_ is the number of processors to be used during the installation.
